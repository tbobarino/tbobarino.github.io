                <h2>Hi, I'm Tommy</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm the kind of engineer who gets genuinely excited about untangling gnarly distributed systems 
                    and turning customer pain points into elegant solutions. For the past decade, I've been deep in 
                    the e-commerce trenches. Inventory management, order flows, channel integrations - the unglamorous 
                    but critical infrastructure that makes commerce actually work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What drives me is building software that real people depend on. I've spent years at Square and 
                    Stitch Labs working on systems that handle millions of transactions, and I've learned that the 
                    best engineering happens when you understand both the business problem and the humans using your code. 
                    Whether I'm extracting a monolith into microservices or debugging why inventory counts are off by 
                    three units, I approach problems with curiosity and a healthy dose of skepticism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thrive in cross-functional environments where I can work closely with product, support, and 
                    business teams. Some of my favorite projects have been integrations that seem simple on the surface 
                    but require deep domain knowledge to get right. I believe in clear communication, taking ownership 
                    of outcomes, and building systems that the next engineer (who might be you at 2 AM) can actually understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also fascinated by how AI is changing our craft. I use modern tools to boost my productivity (from 
                    code generation to research) but I'm a firm believer that human judgment, code review, and understanding 
                    the business context remain irreplaceable. Technology amplifies good engineering practices; it doesn't 
                    replace them.

                        Transitioned from a scrappy startup environment to enterprise software development, learning how 
                        to build systems that serve millions of merchants at global scale. I found my groove working 
                        deeply on specific problem domains. First on Channels (external marketplace integrations) and 
                        later on Platform Inventory (the foundational layer that tracks what merchants have to sell).

                        and external channel synchronization. I learned how to navigate the complexity of large 
                        engineering organizations, collaborate across multiple teams, and build systems that needed to 
                        work reliably for businesses depending on them for their livelihood.

                        This was my real introduction to the startup world, and what a ride it was. Stitch Labs aimed to be 
                        the central hub for inventory, orders, and logistics for online brands. Essentially the operating 
                        system for e-commerce businesses selling across multiple channels. I joined when we were about 20 
                        people and lived through the company's growth to over 100 employees, multiple funding rounds, and 
                        the evolution from serving small businesses to moving upmarket to larger brands.

                        I wore many hats and worked my way up through different roles, from debugging customer issues in

                        all figuring it out together, iterating on the product based on real customer feedback, and learning 
                        how to scale both the technology and the business. It taught me how to work in ambiguous environments, 
                        move fast without breaking things (most of the time), and really understand what customers needed 
                        versus what they said they wanted.

                <h2>How I Approach Problems</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm comfortable learning new stacks and tools, and I care about code quality, observability, 
                    and operational excellence because those are how products keep earning trust after launch. 
                    When hunting down bugs (which I've gotten pretty good at lassoing over the years) I dig deep 
                    into the system's behavior, trace data flows, and often find that the real issue is in the 
                    interaction between components, not where it first appears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're building customer-facing features that demand precise domain logic and thoughtful 
                    systems design, I'd love to connect. I believe the best software comes from understanding 
                    both the business problem and the technical constraints, then finding elegant solutions 
                    that serve real user needs.

                <p>
                    When I'm not chasing down elusive bugs or architecting data flows, I'm probably obsessing over 
                    the Cincinnati Bengals' playoff chances or lamenting another near-miss in my family's fantasy 
                    football league. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, but I keep showing up with confidence 
                    and questionable draft picks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I share my Brooklyn apartment with my husband and two cats who have strong opinions about my code review process 
                    (they prefer the meetings to be shorter and include more treats). In my spare time, I've gotten 
                    into the surprisingly complex world of perfume creation. Turns out there are some interesting 
                    parallels between layering scent notes and building software architecture. Both require patience, 
                    attention to detail, and the ability to iterate until you find the right balance.

                    After watching the early seasons as a kid, I've recently become a hardcore Survivor fan again. I love the strategy, 
                    the alliances, and figuring out how players read the room. It’s satisfying in the same way as debugging: a puzzle 
                    that rewards patience, bluffing, and the occasional bold move. When I'm not tinkering with fragrances or cheering on Cincinnati 
                    sports teams, you'll find me exploring Brooklyn's incredible food scene or swapping Survivor takeaways with anyone who wants to nerd 
                    out over game theory.
